                <div class="french-below-tag">Espresso is the foundation of countless coffee drinks — from cappuccinos
                    to lattes. It’s made by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee under high pressure,
                    producing a small, concentrated shot with a signature crema on top.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="french-content-right">
                How It’s Brewed:<br>
                Finely grind fresh coffee beans (espresso grind).<br>
                Tamp the grounds firmly into the portafilter.<br>
                Extract 30ml of espresso under 9 bars of pressure for about 25–30 seconds.<br>
                Perfect For: Cappuccino, Latte, Americano, Macchiato.<br>
                Pro Tip:
                If the shot tastes sour — grind finer.
                If it tastes bitter — grind coarser. Balance is the secret.</div>

                    most satisfying brewing methods. It uses immersion rather than filtration, allowing natural oils and
                    flavors to shine.</div>

            <div class="expresso-content-right">
                How It’s Brewed:<br>
                Coarsely grind the beans.<br>
                Add 1 part coffee to 15 parts hot water (~200°F).<br>
                Stir gently, then steep for 4 minutes.<br>
                Press the plunger down slowly and pour immediately.<br>
                Perfect For: Strong morning brews and unfiltered flavor lovers.<br>
                Pro Tip:<br>
                Don’t let the coffee sit too long after plunging — it’ll over-extract and taste bitter.</div>

            <div class="pour-content-right">
                How It’s Brewed:<br>
                Use a medium grind coffee.<br>
                Place filter and rinse it with hot water.<br>
                Add grounds and pour water slowly in circles, allowing blooming.<br>
                Continue pouring gradually until total brew time reaches 3–4 minutes.<br>
                Perfect For: Light to medium roast lovers who enjoy clarity and aroma.<br>
                Pro Tip:<br>
                Control your pour — too fast and it’s weak, too slow and it’s bitter. Steady rhythm = perfection.</div>
